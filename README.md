# Tic-Tac-Toe
It is a tic-tac-toe game build by using React js. This is build as a part of React js learning. I have used react state, hook and uplifting state efficiently to finish this application.

Open the repository location and run 'npm install' to install all necessary packages. Then run 'npm run dev' to initiate the live server.
